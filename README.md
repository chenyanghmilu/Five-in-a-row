What is Five-in-a-row:

*Five in a Row*, also called Gomoku aka. Gobang, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board. It can be played using the 15×15 board or the 19×19 board. Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, Gomoku may also be played as a paper-and-pencil game. The game is known in several countries under different names.

Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This game was developed by *HTML5*, *CSS3*, *JavaScript*.

Please check my game [here](https://chenyanghmilu.github.io/Five-in-a-row/) to view, and have fun!

In this version, several unsolved problems such as page layout; background music loading and finial effect of win need to be solved.

This is the version of prototype. In futhur version, I will try to add a AI logical algorithm program to make players vs. computer pattern come true. Multiple play modes and more user friendly UI will be created.
